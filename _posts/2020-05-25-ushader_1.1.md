### **What is the UShader?**

This shaderpack is a recreation of a modified version of SEUS v10.1 I used privately for a long time. Took me a while to match some of the unique looks the SEUS version had but I eventually figured it out. Please note that this pack does not perform better than SEUS v10.1 with the default settings due to many new effects that didn't exist in that version, like volumetric clouds and fog. With the correct settings however it is able to outperform it by a lot while producing much better visuals. It is also important to note that this pack does not use any code from SEUS v10.1.

##### **Changelog**

* added setting for output dither bitdepth
* added caustics
* improved fog upscaling
* improved normals precision (helps a lot with water)
* added support for normalmaps
* settings for blocklight colors
* fixed potential motionblur visual glitches
* adjusted exposure behavior
