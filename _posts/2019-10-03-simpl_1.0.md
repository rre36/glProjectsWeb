This is a new shader that is intended to make the most out of what the base game itself provides.
So this shader is fairly simple (and fast too) as you might have already guessed from it's name.
It stays true to the vanilla look (even more so than vanilla plus) and only builds ontop of it.
The vanilla lightmaps for example remain used instead of being replaced by shader lighting while the vanilla clouds get a slight shading touchup, making them look more integrated.

It features:
* dynamic shadows
* bloom
* temporal anti aliasing
* motionblur
* dynamic sunlight colors
* improved vanilla cloud lighting (set vanilla clouds to fancy for best results)
